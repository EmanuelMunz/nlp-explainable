John's a man of few words with a lot of guns :-)Chapter 1 was the better film - more of a story at the start, but this is good and easy entertainment for its genre.Not for the faint-hearted as its pretty violent but the fighting and consequences are real enough (basically you know he's not going to leave anyone around who could kill him later on!).Looking forward to seeing what happens next in Chapter 3",1.0,neutral,1,1,1,1,1

Bad guys still have a total inability to shoot straight, Bond still never feels like he's in any real danger, whether poisoned, tortured or shot at, and the action pieces are still far from realistic.Casino Royale is a progression of the Brosnan movies, but it's not a revolution by any means.Saying that it's still a good film. Bond, as usual, is tracking down the villain, beind double crossed at every turn and as ever under the thumb of M. There are elements that have been lost, no more Q, no more gadgets and Daniel Craig is now the eye candy.Personally this feels like a watered down Bond film, without the gritty style or realisticness that has been touted.

The storyline is less built for a wide cinema audience and more for Bond experts who have read the books, followed the films closely.This step change in the films brought some mixed reviews - you either loved or hated it - I found it wasn't as bad as I'd expected - I still miss Brosnan like mad but Craig was never a replacement for his Bond it was about taking it back to basics and they have achieved that well.",1.0,neutral,1,1,1,1,1

Obviously I bought the set because I have a bluray player, however, the DVD may give some people issues. Some older DVD's would likely be unable to play the disc, and even if your DVD player can handle it, the picture quality is going to be reduced in comparison to a properly encoded DVD for Region 2 (ie: PAL).Additionally, the Amazon listing shows the set as being Region Free. This may well turn out to be the case, but for anyone unsure, it's worth noting that both the packaging and discs themselves show Region B for the bluray, and Region 2 for the DVD.

I couldn't believe a so called blu-ray could look this awful. I bet the Dvd format might actually look better than this terrible outing. Story is average and rather predictable. Audio is pretty good especially if you have surround sound set up and a scene at night with the men huddled around the campfire being surrounded by growling wolves which are just out of sight in the dark provides a good example of a decent surround audio.

There was no attempt to explain the rules to the audience, many of whom may have had only a passing familiarity with the standard game of poker. The producers said that they wanted to make the film as close to the book as possible, so why drop baccarat in favour of Texas Hold-em poker? In many other ways the film was nothing like the book.

Little ""Hunger"" in evidence.I also forsee some difficulties arising in the sequels as this rather tougher character will be difficult to give a convincing breakdown, and while Woody Harleson's character was entertaining, he had none of the edge of a man driven to despair by the loss of family, and of mentoring 25 years of unsuccessful tributes - where was the tragedy of 50 childs lives in his hands?

This film takes us to Florence,Venice and Istanbul as Tom Hanks gets involved in a race to save the world from a deadly virus being released. He starts the film with amnesia and as he gradually recovers it he realises that the situation he is in is not what meets the eye.

As a long-time fan of Stephen Hunter, 'Point of Impact' (the source of 'Shooter') is one of my favourite novels, but this misses the magic, the pathos and heart of Hunter's work. Mark Wahlberg does his best, but he is miscast - he is too small and runty and emotionally shallow - Hunter's Swagger is a tall, rangy southerner, a brooding, tortured loner. Even more miscast is Danny Glover - he's always been rubbish, but here he is painful.
